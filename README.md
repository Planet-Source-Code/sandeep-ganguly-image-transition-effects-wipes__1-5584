## Image Transition Effects \(Wipes\)


</div>

### Description

Wipes is an image transition program allowing you to use various transition effects like Wipes, Slides, Stretches, Grow from Corner, Random blocks, Stripes, Blinds, Maze etc. You can individually load the pictures and apply the effects, or set an directory and then allow Wipes to apply its preset sequence of transition(some customization is possible here). Or you can write you own scripts to customize the pictures, effects, time delays, background sound and whether the animation and sound should loop! PLEASE READ THE "README.TXT" FILE BEFORE USE.

Enjoy!
